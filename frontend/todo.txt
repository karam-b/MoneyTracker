// very important / bugs -----------------------------------------------
- [x] Chart page
 
- [x] export page
- [x] setting page + rate us + about
 
- [ ] offline users

- [ ] deploy the app

- [x] unify backend and frontend data types and TypeScript 


- [x] __BACKEND__ bug: `these fields are required: ` no fields are showing
  
// rest -----------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] loading pages is not smooth

- [ ] frontend bug: sing in > go offline 
        > go online (you will see notification with sign out option) 
        > go to `/export` 
        > sign out from that notification

this may need to refactor the whole react-router setup

- [ ] when created doc optional fields are null, but on getting doc optional fields don't exist


- [x] empty logs and empty categories

- [ ] __BACKEND__: refactor testing in backend

- [ ] __BACKEND__: document the backend

- [ ] refactor `store.dispatch('META_XXX')`
 
- [x] refactor redux api and actions

- [ ] sync with banks


// unnecessary but very cool --------------------------------------------
- [ ] figure out a way to display pages like export or addLog without a modal

- [ ] on the home page add component to create logs without opening a whole new modal

- [x] commands + stack notification + undo commands

- [ ] animation on deleting entries
 

// unnecessary ----------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] progressive app
 
- [ ] move to react native??
