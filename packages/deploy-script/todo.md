this is all the features I wish I can provide

- [ ] push the code in `terraform` directory to the API-driven workflow
- [ ] trigger topical plan/apply run on that workflow 

less important, but will enhance the automation
- [ ] automatically create an API-driven workflow for each workspace that have deploy script see `createWorkspace.js`. [see documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#create-a-workspace)

bugs:
- [ ]
